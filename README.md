# Nabu
A python tool for writing interactive fiction. 

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND MAY NOT WORK

## Design

Nabu uses Jinja templates to create an HTML document from the supplied story yaml file, and then renders it out to a PDF with internal links for the readers choices.

## Installation

first clone the repo

    git clone git@github.com:sterlingbaldwin/nabu.git

install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

install the package

    pip install -e .

## Story 

The story is described via a yaml document, with each page consisting of a block of content, and then a set of choices. Each story has three mandatory elements, a title page, a start page, and an end page. They should look something like:

    title: A Dark and Stormy Night
    author_name: Sterling Baldwin
    author_contact: https://github.com/sterlingbaldwin
    cover_image: story-cover.jpg
    chapters:
    -
        name: Chapter One
        id: chapter_1
        image: stormy_night.jpg
        mini_image: pirate_portrait.png
        pages:
        -
            name: on_the_beach
            contents: 
            - 
                "It was a dark and stormy night, the the waves beat themselves across the beach
                and the wind lashed my hair across my face. I could taste bitter salt dropplets from the ocean
                with a thousand microscopic sea creatures in my mouth."
            -
                "Before me was a boat, not much more then a dingy, bouncing about in the rough water. To my right 
                was a path leading into the dunes, beset on one side by a wall of thorny brambles."
            choices: 
            - 
                description: Climb into the boat and row into the waves
                target: row_the_boat
            -
                description: Walk along the path, keeping a good distance from those thorns
                target: walk_the_bramble_path



The "title" will be the first page and link to the "start". The "start" page will be the entry point to the story, and any page without a "choices" section will link to the end page. 

The contents of the page can be either a single string, or a list of paragraphs. 

Each story should have an "img" directory where images for the story should also be stored.

### NOTE

Annoyingly, and for no reason I've been able to figure out yet, you should always have at least two paragraphs per page, or the top border on the first choice wont appear.

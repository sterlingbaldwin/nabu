            "It was a dark and stormy night, the the waves beat themselves across the beach
          and the wind lashed my hair across my face. I could taste bitter salt dropplets from the ocean
          with a thousand microscopic sea creatures in my mouth."
          - 
            "The sand of the beach crunches under my feet and I feel the soft give of the surface decorming under
            my shoes as I walk down towards the water, drawn by the sound of the waves towards the crashing surf."
          -
            "Before me was a boat, not much more then a dingy, bouncing about in the rough water. To my right 
          was a path leading into the dunes, beset on one side by a wall of thorny brambles."

            "turning away from the water, start along the bramble path. Sharp thorns seem to line every one of the
          endless writhing vines, forming an impenetrable wall along one side of the path. Soon the brambles tower over head,
          interweaving above me and blocking the thin light of the moon, plunging my into darkness"

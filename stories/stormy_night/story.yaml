walk the bramble path:
  contents: "turning away from the water, start along the bramble path. Sharp thorns seem to line every one of the
    endless writhing vines, forming an impenetrable wall along one side of the path. Soon the brambles tower over head,
    interweaving above me and blocking the thin light of the moon, plunging my into darkness"
